Just finished this book, and what a ride it's been. Here's my thoughts.

Ever seen Goodfellas? It's a 1990 movie by Martin Scorcese who wracked up a ton of well-deserved awards. This book is the basis of that movie. It's a real life, non-fiction book about Henry Hill, a titular "wise guy" - a mafioso (though the name is never once used in the book itself). It portrays his rise (descent?) into the Lucchese crime family, and subsequent fall from grace, until he is all but forced to go into witness protection.
