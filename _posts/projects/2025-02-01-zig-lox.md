I've been working through Robert Nystrom's [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) for the last couple months. I already did jlox (his language Lox, built in Java), but found that by going through it following the author, I ended up learning little.

As such, I set myself the challenge of doing the second part of the book, clox, a bytecode VM, in Zig, to get more familiar with the language, and to really get in the weeds of design decisions. I'll chronicle my progress (or lack thereof) here, so you can see how a noob goes through things.

(yes, I am doing a CS PhD, but did not have any compiler background, am learning the ropes now, cut me some slack)

### Header guards

No need for these whatsoever in Zig!
