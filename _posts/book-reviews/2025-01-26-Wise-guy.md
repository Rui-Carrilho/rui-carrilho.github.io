Just finished this book, and what a ride it's been. Here's my thoughts.

Ever seen Goodfellas? It's a 1990 movie by Martin Scorcese who wracked up a ton of well-deserved awards. This book is the basis of that movie. It's a real life, non-fiction book about Henry Hill, a titular "wise guy" - a mafioso (though the name is never once used in the book itself). It portrays his rise (descent?) into the Lucchese crime family, and subsequent fall from grace, until he is all but forced to go into witness protection. It's an extremely wild ride, I'll say that much to start with.

It starts off looking into the early life of Henry Hill, son of some no-name electrician (back then, they made next to no money), with a ton of brothers and sisters, living in a shady street. In said street, there was a pizza place, where some suspiciously rich people were known to loiter and spend some time going in and out. One day, while looking for a job to help the family make ends meet, Henry wanders into that place, and enters the world of self-styled wise guys.
