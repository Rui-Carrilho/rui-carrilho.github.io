Like many, I have pondered what life is gonna look like when AGI is finally here. And here's what I think:

I have no fucking idea.

Firstly, how exactly do we define AGI? This seems like the most important place for us to begin, since for all our bickering, nobody seems to quite have defined what that is in a concrete way. Do we all agree on a test which, when passed, can conclusively prove AGI? If not, then whenever someone claims to have achieved it, they can simply be disputed by someone else.

Let's try to think of it like this - we will have achieved AGI when we can give the PC any amount of data, in any form, and it accurately grasps and can manipulate that data towards our intended purposes. What does a world post-this look like?

Well, we can look at this in two ways. There are jobs that will no longer be needed. Things that LLMs can easily do, manipulating textual info and so on just aren't as necessary. A human will need to verify the results... at first. Then his role will become more symbolic. And finally unnecessary. I don't know how long it takes to get there.

But now, what jobs will still be needed? Well, until robots truly come online, physical labor will still be needed.

See, I'm sensing a common pattern around all LLMs. At the start, we think each one is the hottest shit around, can easily solve
