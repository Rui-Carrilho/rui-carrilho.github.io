This book is all about the major breakthroughs that lead to our intelligence as it is today. It wastes no time in telling you that most of the five breakthroughs mentioned are conjectures - indeed, as many of them happened before recorded history, there's no way they'd be anything else. Nonetheless, I wouldn't be surprised if most, or all of those conjectures are correct, and consider this to be a foundational read for the area.

The book is roughly divided into five parts, with each part corresponding to a single breakthrough. These happen in order, so the book should be considered sequentially and reads quite well in that regard. Each part consists of many chapters fleshing it out. The structure is therefore repetitive, but that is a plus in a work like this, as it gives you a structure to better digest it with. 

I will divide this review into five parts corresponding to each of the corresponding book parts as well.

### Breakthrough #1 - Steering
I'd say this is the most unexpectedly interesting chapter in the whole book. Bennett introduces the first breakthrough as the ability to steer towards... well, whatever good stuff you're after. He points out a ton of things that are, upon inspection, somewhat obvious, such as the fact that bilaterian organisms (beings with two symmetrical sides, i.e - a left and a right) are basically the epitome of steering, and how steering already presupposes that you can divide the world into "good" (worth steering towards) and "bad" (worth steering away from). 

From here, he deduces many important conclusions - that these very basic starting points are essentially the spawning point of emotion, association, prediction, and the entirety of learning

### Breakthrough #2 - Reinforcing


### Breakthrough #3 - Simulating


### Breakthrough #4 - Mentalizing


### Breakthrough #5 - Speaking
